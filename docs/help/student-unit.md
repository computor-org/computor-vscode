## What is a Unit?

A **Unit** (also called a course folder or course group) is an organizational container within a course. It groups related assignments, readings, and other content together - typically by week, module, topic, or concept.

## What You See

Units appear with a colored circle icon:

```
📖 Introduction to Programming
├── ⚫ Week 1 - Introduction
├── ⚫ Week 2 - Data Types
└── ⚫ Week 3 - Control Flow
```

The color of the circle icon indicates the **content type** defined by your instructor (e.g., homework, lab, exam).

## Unit Information

### Tooltip Information

When you hover over a unit, you'll see detailed information:

```
Unit: Week 1 - Introduction
5 items
Type: Lab
2 unread messages
```

**What each line means:**

1. **Unit: [Name]** - The unit title
2. **[X] items** - How many assignments, readings, or sub-units are inside
3. **Type: [Content Type]** - The category (Lab, Homework, Exam, etc.) set by the instructor
4. **[X] unread messages** - Number of new announcements or discussions (only shown if > 0)

### Description in Tree

Next to the unit name, you'll see a compact summary:

```
⚫ Week 1 - Introduction    🔔 2 • 5 items
```

- **🔔 [X]** - Unread message count (bell icon shown only if there are unread messages)
- **[X] items** - Total number of items inside this unit

## Available Actions

Right-click on a unit to access:

### Show Messages

**When to use:**

## Understanding Unit Organization

Units can be nested and contain mixed content:

```
⚫ Week 1 - Introduction (5 items)
├── 📄 Lecture 1: Overview
├── 📝 Lab 1: Hello World
├── ⚫ Optional Reading (2 items)
│   ├── 📄 Advanced Topics
│   └── 📄 Historical Context
└── 📝 Homework 1: Variables
```

## Content Types and Colors

Different units may have different colored icons based on their **content type**:

- Instructors define content types (e.g., "Homework", "Lab", "Exam", "Project")
- Each type gets a unique color
- This visual coding helps you quickly identify the type of work

**Example:**
- 🔵 Blue circles = Labs
- 🟢 Green circles = Homework
- 🔴 Red circles = Exams

*(Actual colors depend on your instructor's configuration)*

## Messages and Notifications

### Unread Message Indicator

When a unit has unread messages, you'll see:

```
⚫ Week 1    🔔 2 • 5 items
```

The **🔔 bell icon** with a number tells you how many messages you haven't read yet.

**What messages might include:**
- Unit-specific announcements
- Clarifications about assignments in this unit
- Deadline extensions
- Tips and hints
- Instructor feedback

### Checking Messages

1. Right-click on the unit
2. Select **Show Messages**
3. Read and respond to messages
4. The unread count will update automatically

## Tips

- **Expand units to see contents** - Click the arrow to reveal assignments and readings
- **Check unread messages promptly** - Important information might be time-sensitive
- **Units organize your work** - Think of them as weekly modules or topic sections
- **Nested structure is intentional** - Instructors organize content logically to guide your learning
