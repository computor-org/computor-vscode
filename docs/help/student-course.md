# Student Guide: Courses

## What is a Course?

A **Course** is the top-level container in your student view. It represents a complete class or module you're enrolled in, such as "Introduction to Programming" or "Data Structures".

## What You See

When you see a course in your tree view:

```
📖 Introduction to Programming
```

The book icon (📖) indicates this is a course root. Clicking it expands to show all course content, including units and assignments.

## Course Information

```

## Understanding Course Organization

Courses are organized hierarchically:

├── 📁 Week 2 - Data Types
│   ├── 📝 Lab 2

```
