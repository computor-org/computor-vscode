## What is an Assignment?

An **Assignment** is a submittable task with a Git repository where you write code, complete exercises, or create deliverables. Assignments are the core interactive element of your coursework - you clone them, work on them, test them, and submit them for grading.

## What You See

Assignments appear with a colored square icon:

```
📖 Introduction to Programming
├── ⚫ Week 1
│   ├── 🟦 Lab 1: Hello World
│   └── 🟦 Homework 1: Variables
└── 🟦 Final Project
```

The color of the square icon indicates the **content type** (lab, homework, exam, etc.) defined by your instructor.

## Assignment Information

### Tooltip Information

When you hover over an assignment, you'll see comprehensive details:

```
Repository: john-doe/cs101-lab1
Type: Lab
Unread messages: 1
Tests: 2 of 5
Submissions: 1 of 3
Result: 85.50%
Grading: 90.00%
Status: Corrected
Team members:
  - John Doe
  - Jane Smith
```

**What each line means:**

1. **Repository: [path]** - Your personal Git repository full path (e.g., `username/course-assignment`)
2. **Type: [Content Type]** - Assignment category (Lab, Homework, Exam, Project, etc.)
3. **Unread messages: [X]** - New announcements or feedback messages (only shown if > 0)
4. **Tests: [X] of [Y]** - Test runs you've used out of maximum allowed
   - Example: "2 of 5" means you've run tests 2 times, with 3 attempts remaining
   - If no limit: shows just the count (e.g., "Tests: 2")
5. **Submissions: [X] of [Y]** - Submissions made out of maximum allowed
   - Example: "1 of 3" means you've submitted once, with 2 submissions remaining
   - **Important:** Once you reach the limit, you cannot submit again
6. **Result: [X]%** - Your latest test result percentage (0-100%)
   - Based on automated test execution
   - Updates when you run local tests or submit
7. **Grading: [X]%** - Your official grade from the instructor (0-100%)
   - Only appears after grading
   - May differ from test results (instructors can adjust grades)
8. **Status** - Grading/correction status:
   - **Corrected** - Assignment has been graded
   - **Correction Necessary** - Instructor requires changes
   - **Correction Possible** - You can revise and resubmit
9. **Team members** - List of collaborators (only shown for team assignments)

### Description in Tree

Next to the assignment name, you'll see compact metrics:

```
🟦 Lab 1: Hello World    🔔 1 [2/5] [1/3] 85%
```

- **🔔 [X]** - Unread messages (bell icon, only if unread > 0)
- **[X/Y]** - Test runs used (e.g., `[2/5]`)
- **[X/Y]** - Submissions made (e.g., `[1/3]`)
- **[X]%** - Current result percentage (e.g., `85%`)

## Assignment Lifecycle

### 1. Work on Your Code

1. Edit files in your preferred editor
2. Make changes to complete the assignment requirements
3. Save your work frequently

**Tips:**
- Read the README for instructions (click preview icon or right-click → **Show README Preview**)
- Follow the assignment structure - don't rename required files
- Commit your work regularly (even before it's perfect)

### 2. Test Locally

Before submitting, run automated tests to check your work.

**How to test:**
1. Click the **🧪 beaker icon** next to the assignment (inline action)
   - Or right-click → **Test Assignment**
2. Tests execute locally on your machine
3. Results appear in the **Test Results** panel (bottom panel)
4. Click on failed tests to jump to the relevant code

**Important:**
- Testing uses one of your test attempts (if limited)
- **Tests: [X] of [Y]** in the tooltip shows remaining attempts
- Test locally before submitting to catch errors early
- Green checkmark badge = tests passing
- Red X badge = tests failing

**Viewing test results:**
- Right-click → **Show Test Results** to see detailed output
- Test results persist even after closing VS Code

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Save your progress to the Git repository regularly.

**How to commit:**
1. Click the **📝 git commit icon** next to the assignment (inline action)
   - Or right-click → **Commit Assignment**
2. Enter a descriptive commit message (e.g., "Implemented sorting function")
3. Changes are committed and pushed to your remote repository

**Committing everything at once:** all the assignments of a course share one
repository, so right-clicking the **course** and choosing **Commit Course** saves
every assignment you have worked on in a single step.

**Why commit often:**
- Saves your progress remotely (backup)
- Allows instructors to see your work-in-progress
- Creates a history of your development process
- Required before submission

### 4. Submit the Assignment

When you're ready to be graded, submit your work.

**How to submit:**
1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Click the **☁️ upload icon** next to the assignment (inline action)
   - Or right-click → **Submit Assignment**
3. Submission is created on the backend
4. You'll see the submission count increase

**Important:**
- **Submissions are limited!** Check "Submissions: [X] of [Y]" before submitting
- You cannot submit after reaching the maximum
- Only submit when you're confident in your work
- You can view submission details: right-click → **View Details**

### 5. View Feedback and Grades

After submission, instructors review and grade your work.

**How to check feedback:**
- Right-click → **View Details** to see:
  - Submission information
  - Test results
  - Grading percentage
  - Instructor comments
- Right-click → **Show Messages** for feedback discussions

**Status indicators:**
- **Corrected** - Graded and finalized
- **Correction Necessary** - Instructor requires changes (you may need to revise)
- **Correction Possible** - You can resubmit (if submissions remain)

### Inline Action Icons

Icons that appear to the right of the assignment name:

1. **📖 Preview icon** - Show README preview
2. **🧪 Beaker icon** - Test assignment (only if cloned)
3. **📝 Commit icon** - Commit changes (only if cloned)
4. **☁️ Upload icon** - Submit assignment (only if cloned)
5. **☁️ Download icon** - Clone repository (only if not cloned)

## Working with Files

Expand an assignment to see its files:

```
🟦 Lab 1: Hello World
├── 📄 src/
│   ├── main.py
│   └── utils.py
├── 📄 tests/
│   └── test_main.py
└── 📄 README.md
```

Click a file to open it. Right-click a file, a folder, or the assignment itself
for the actions below. Everything here happens **only on your own computer** —
nothing is uploaded until you commit.

### Creating

- **New File…** — right-click the assignment or a folder, type a name
- **New Folder…** — the same, for a folder

The new file opens straight away.

### Copying and Moving

- **Copy File…** — pick a destination folder; the original stays where it is
- **Move File…** — pick a destination folder; the file is moved there

Both offer only folders **inside the same assignment**, so you cannot move your
work into a different exercise by mistake. If a file of that name is already
there, you are asked whether to **Keep Both** or **Overwrite**.

### Deleting

- **Delete File**
- **Delete Folder** — removes everything inside it

You are always asked to confirm first.

Deleting is not as final as it sounds: anything that came with the assignment can
be brought back — see [Getting a File Back from the Template](#getting-a-file-back-from-the-template).

### Renaming and Duplicating

- **Rename…** — give the file or folder a new name
- **Duplicate** — make a copy next to it, named `main copy.py`

### Cut, Copy and Paste

The familiar two-step alternative to *Copy File…* / *Move File…*: **Cut** or
**Copy** a file, then **Paste** into a folder or onto the assignment. **Paste**
only appears once something is waiting.

### Paths

- **Copy Path** — the full path of the selected file, folder or assignment
- **Copy Relative Path** — its path within the repository
- **Reveal in File Explorer** — shows it in the file manager, or in the VS Code
  Explorer when you are working in the browser

If your browser refuses to let Computor write to the clipboard, the path is shown
in a box instead so you can copy it with Ctrl/Cmd+C.

### What You Cannot Change

A few things are managed by Computor and are hidden or protected:

- `.git` — the repository's own data
- `README.md`, `README_de.md` and `mediaFiles` at the top of an assignment — the
  assignment description, which your lecturer maintains

You can create and edit READMEs in sub-folders as much as you like.

## Getting a File Back from the Template

If you have ruined a file that came with the assignment — a data file, a figure,
or the starter code — you can get a fresh copy:

1. **Copy anything you want to keep first** (right-click → *Copy File…*).
2. **Delete** the file.
3. Right-click the **course** and choose **Update Repository from Template**.

Every file the course material has and your folder does not is restored. Files
you still have are left untouched, so this never overwrites your work — which is
also why deleting the file first is a required step, not a shortcut.

The same action brings in new material your lecturer has released since you
started.

## Common Scenarios

### Starting a New Assignment

1. Read the README: Click preview icon 📖
2. Start coding: Open and edit files
3. Commit early: Save your initial work

### Debugging Test Failures

1. Run tests: Click beaker icon 🧪
2. View results: Right-click → **Show Test Results**
3. Click on failed test to jump to code
4. Fix the issue
5. Commit changes
6. Run tests again

### Submitting Work

1. Ensure all changes are committed (use commit icon 📝)
2. Run final tests (beaker icon 🧪)
3. Verify tests pass (check badge or results panel)
4. Check submission count: Hover to see "Submissions: [X] of [Y]"
5. Submit: Click upload icon ☁️

### After Receiving Feedback

1. Check messages: Right-click → **Show Messages**
2. View details: Right-click → **View Details**
3. Read instructor comments
4. If "Correction Necessary":
   - Make required changes
   - Commit updates
   - Test again
   - Resubmit (if submissions remain)

## Tips and Best Practices

### Commit Frequently
- Commit after completing each feature or section
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Don't wait until the assignment is perfect

### Test Before Submitting
- Always run tests locally first
- Fix all test failures if possible
- Understand what each test checks

### Manage Test Attempts
- If test runs are limited, use them wisely
- Debug code before running tests
- Review test code to understand requirements

### Watch Submission Limits
- Know your limit: Check "Submissions: [X] of [Y]"
- Don't waste submissions on incomplete work
- Test thoroughly before submitting

### Read Messages
- Check unread message count (🔔 bell icon)
- Instructors may post important clarifications
- Respond promptly to feedback requests

### Understand the Metrics
- **Result %** = Automated test score (technical correctness)
- **Grading %** = Instructor's final grade (may include style, documentation, etc.)
- These may differ - grading is the official score

## Troubleshooting

### "I deleted a file I needed"
- Right-click the course → **Update Repository from Template**
- See [Getting a File Back from the Template](#getting-a-file-back-from-the-template)

### "Cannot clone repository"
- Ensure you have a workspace directory selected
- Check your network connection
- Verify you have access to the course

### "Tests won't run"
- Ensure repository is cloned and opened in VS Code
- Check that dependencies are installed
- Review test output in the Test Results panel

### "Submission failed"
- Ensure all changes are committed first
- Check that you haven't exceeded submission limit
- Verify network connection to backend

### "No test attempts remaining"
- You've used all allowed test runs
- Contact your instructor if you need more attempts
- Submit your best effort based on current work
